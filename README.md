**INACTIVE** - tagesschau Roku Channel 
==================================

*Please note*: This project is **inactive** since tagesschau has released their official Roku Channel.  
Also, my code is very likely oudated/obsolete and I have not tested it for a number of years.

# *(Outdated)* Project Description
The tagesschau Roku channel allows streaming current videos, complete broadcasts and background information from Germany's trusted public broadcaster ARD using [Roku](http://www.roku.com) streaming players.

This git repository hosts the complete [BrightScript](http://sdkdocs.roku.com/display/sdkdoc/BrightScript+Language+Reference) source code and artwork of the tagesschau Roku channel. Please note that it is *not* an official channel by ARD but developed and maintained by [me](https://github.com/henningSaul) as a side project in my spare time. I hope you enjoy it. --Henning
